Instructions for Compiling Task 1 and Advanced Task

Task 1

Structure of files:
- c_list.h — Header file
- c_list.c — Implementation file
- main.c — File with the main function

Compilation Steps:
1. Make sure all files (c_list.h, c_list.c, main.c) are in the same folder.
2. Open the terminal in this folder.
3. Run the compilation command:
   gcc main.c c_list.c -o task1_program
   This will create an executable file named 'task1_program' (or 'task1_program.exe' on Windows).
4. Run the program:
   ./task1_program  or task1_program.exe

Advanced Task

Structure of files:
- advanced_task.c — Contains all the program code.

Compilation Steps:
1. Make sure that 'advanced_task.c' is in the folder where you plan to compile.
2. Open the terminal in this folder.
3. Run the compilation command:
   gcc advanced_task.c -o advanced_task
   This will create an executable file named 'advanced_task' (or 'advanced_task.exe' on Windows).
4. Run the program:
   ./advanced_task or advanced_task.exe
